# Cold Email Automation Pipeline

Automate your job search and HR outreach with a robust, Python-powered workflow. This project lets you send engaging, personalized emails (with your resume attached) to hundreds of HR contacts in batchesâ€”while logging responses live in Excel and making every interaction count.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Batch Sending:** Emails go out in batches (default 100 per run), keeping you safe from Gmail limits.  
- **Smart Reply Checks:** Detects previous replies before emailing and prevents duplicates.  
- **Live Excel Logging:** Updates `hr_contacts.xlsx` in real time, tracking who was sent and who has replied.  
- **Dynamic Personalization:** Every message features a real, custom line for the company.  
- **Resume Attachment:** Attaches your resume from a dedicated folder automatically.  
- **Idempotent:** Each run only contacts new HRsâ€”never doubles up or misses status.  
- **Configurable & Open Source:** Set it up with your Google account for full privacy and control.

## ðŸ”‘ About the `credentials` Folder & Google OAuth Setup

### Why Use Your Own Google OAuth API?

For secure, authorized access to your Gmail account, you **must create your own OAuth credentials via Google Cloud**. Never share your credentials files online, and always use your own for privacy.

### How to Obtain and Configure `credentials.json`

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
2. Create/Open a Project.  
3. Enable the Gmail API (APIs & Services > Enable APIs and Services > search "Gmail API" > Enable).  
4. Configure OAuth consent screen (choose External user type and complete minimal setup).  
5. Create OAuth Client ID (Credentials > Create > OAuth client ID > Desktop app).  
6. Download the `credentials.json` and place it in the `credentials/` folder in your project.  
7. On first script run, authenticate with Google in the browser; this will create `token.json` in `credentials/`.

*(continue with the rest of your README content similarly, with clear headings, bullet lists, code blocks, and blank lines)*

### Additional Tips

- Preview your README in GitHub or a Markdown viewer to check formatting before committing.  
- Use a Markdown editor (Typora, VS Code with Markdown Preview) for easier writing.  
- If pasting from somewhere that loses formatting, manually fix indentation and blank lines before saving.

If you want, I can also prepare a **Markdown (.md) file** formatted exactly for GitHub so you can copy-paste it directly without losing structure. Just let me know!
